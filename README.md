# PhantasiaEngine
## An experimental 2D game engine written in Java

This engine uses a single png as the "map" along with a corresponding black & white image as the collision map (where black represents a wall).  
It supports sprite animations, dynamic sounds that vary with distance and surface, camera scrolling, FMV playback and online play via websockets.  
The only supported renderer is AWT-based.
